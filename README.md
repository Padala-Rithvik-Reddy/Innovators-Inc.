There are two different codes: a basic version and an advanced version.

The basic code is a fully self-made, rule-based AI prediction system that does not rely on pre-trained models or external libraries, except for fundamental ones. It calls the keystroke_module, which defines key combinations. When input is passed to the execute_command() method, it executes the keystrokes on a USB-connected device.

The advanced version builds on the same concept but integrates APIs for voice-to-speech and prediction, making it more reliable and efficient.

This concept enables autonomous robots, such as Optimus or the Curiosity bot, to seamlessly operate a computer or system by simulating keystrokes instead of physically typing. Traditional robotic hands face challenges in typing, including mechanical wear, precision errors (average 3-5% key miss rate), and slower speeds (30-50 WPM for robotic hands vs. 100+ WPM for keystroke-based execution).
In contrast, using keystroke-based execution eliminates these physical limitations, improving accuracy to near 100% and increasing input speed by at least 2x. Additionally, the absence of mechanical movements reduces energy consumption and extends hardware lifespan.
By replacing complex motion algorithms with direct keystroke execution, robots can interact with computers more efficiently, reducing the need for intricate AI training and enhancing operational reliability.


the computer_vision_advancements will be integrated with the ai assitant pendrive code with features recognizing a human sending messages to whatsapp contact and so on in the future iterations
